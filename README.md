* nrgOutreach.py - Python CGI file. Takes the name, process the `nrgOutreach.csv` file, and display the output. The webpage style mirrors everything on index.html.
* nrgOutreach.csv - User data to be processed.
* /assets - Javascript, CSS, imgs, & more!
* /upload - Uploads the csv files onto the site! ~Written in PHP due to the authorâ€™s lack of knowledge of using upload with Python.
